# hello-word
My initial repository on GitHub
My name is Jeffrey and I signed up GitHub because I want to know the programmers comunity and get envolved with it. I have the ambitious of becaming a web designer and nothing is better than get to know other who already are web developers. Also when I achieve my target I want to help others with the same goals!
